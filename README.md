This reposiritory contains the files and presenation for a Galaxy Tutorial.

The main purpose is to capture some of the lessons learned during my year working with Galaxy.

This is by no means a full description of Galaxy and should be used in combination with the Galaxy documentations.

All tools here are toy examples to teach or demonstate a point and are not intended to be useful or unique tools.
